    Why donate to alonetone?
  </h2>
  <div class="static_content">
    Alonetone is free to use, non-commercial, ad-free and open source. It will always be this way. However, running it does cost money, and some folks have been asking about giving back. 
    <br/><br/>
        At first I always said "I don't want your money!" and "I want alonetone to be money-free!"....but then I realized some folks  really <b>want</b> to help out, to chip in their fare share, and feel some ownership.
        After all, this isn't only <b>my</b> home. This is <b>your</b> home, and if you want to chip in to the running costs, it's appreciated.

    How much does alonetone cost Sudara?
  </h2>
  <div class="static_content">
    alonetone hosting currently costs $80/month for hosting and about $100/month for delivering the music. So, not too bad, it's around $2,000 a year for hosting.
    <br/><br/>
    Additionally, there are the services of our designer, who I try to pay fairly more often than not. 
    <br/><br/>
    And of course there is my time for support, maintenance and development, which I happily donate because I believe in us having a non-commerical place to share our music.

    Will alonetone die a fiery death if I don't donate?
  </h2>
  <div class="static_content">
    Nope! We're accepting donations primarily because a) people have been asking for it and b) Our costs recently doubled as our hosting is no longer free.
