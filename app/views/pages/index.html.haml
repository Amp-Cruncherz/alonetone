  %h2.question
    Is this a website for musicians?
  %p.answer
    Yup, we work our butt off to give musicians a damn fine home. But Wait! If you love music but don't craft it, there is still a lot
    to do here, including discover new music, create playlists and share the music you find with others.

  %h2.question
    Can I upload my mp3s here?
  %p.answer
    If you made the music, then of course!

    %br If you didn't make the music, and just want to share it, then no...go elsewhere!

  %h2.question
    I mean, I reallllllly don't get it: Why alonetone?
  %p.answer
    Commercial services for musicians exist. We want to give you something different.
    We are not interested in making a buck off of you. We are interested in getting musicians on their feet
    on the web and allowing folks to solidly deliver their music, known or unknown.
    %br
    %br
    Even the other 'free' services you'll run into elsewhere are running ads or funded
    by investors hoping to make it big and meanwhile making money off of your "content"...erm music
    %br
    %br
    Beyond that, we want to do it right. Clean, and only the essentials.

  %h2.question
    Ok, no companies, great. So, who makes alonetone?
  %p.answer
    Right now, all concept and programming is handled by me,

    My music has been online (for free) since 2002 at

    How long will it be free?  
  %p.answer
    As long as alonetone exists.
.faq  
  %h2.question
    Can I sell my music here?
  %p.answer
    Nope. There are many places that you can sell your music at, if you want to take a crack at it.
    %br
    %br I personally believe (and always have) that selling mp3s really won't bring the average musician much luck,
    %br but you can always try. If you have success, let me know!
.faq    
  %h2.question
    But I want to make money with my music.
  %p.answer
    I believe that you can and should be able to. But not by selling mp3s, sorry. The music world is changing fast,
    and the selling mp3s option is a short-term and short-lived last ditch effort on behalf of the changing industry.
    At this point, your best bet is to play live, or get your music into as many hands as you can. 
    =link_to 'We can help with the latter.', signup_path
    As far as other 'new' methods, I've got a couple ideas along these lines, some of which play off of alonetone. In time, you
    might see some of them appear! Ask me about them if you want at sudara [AT] alonetone [dizzot] com
.faq   
  %h2.question
    So, I can basically upload my music and give it away. That's it? Oh, and it's free.
  %p.answer
    That is the most important bit, but there is more.
    %br
    %br You can create and organize playlists of your music or the music of others. 
    You can track who is listening to your music, and where.
    You can put your music on any website, and we handle all of the traffic. 
    You upload it once here, then use it wherever you want.

    Hey, I really want to share this Radiohead/Britney Spears/Band XYZ track with my friend. Can I?
  %p.answer
    Cool. Do it. Over email. Or use another service. But not here! 
    %br We're on your side, but this is the wrong venue. We're small time normal human being musicians, 
    %br and running into copyright issues and having to delete tracks and accounts is not something we want to handle.
.faq  
  %h2.question
    I don't get it, isn't this costing you money? Are you stupid, insane, or just bad at business?
  %p.answer
    There are some costs, primarily the Amazon S3 storage costs. If the site explodes big, then the costs will be significant,
    but not unmanageable.
    %br
    %br
    I pay these out of pocket for a few reasons: I want to promote independent music and display the wonderful amazing fact
    that the music distribution model has changed. I mean, one average person can singlehandedly float thousands of musicians and tens of thousands
    of mp3s and hundreds of thousands of downloads. Incredible - it points to crazy amazing future world of music. Oh yeah,
    and with current industry turbulence, I want to make sure the average kid and professional has access to free distribution.
.faq   
  %h2.question
    What if the site explodes in popularity and the costs become prohibitive?
  %p.answer
    In the event that the I can no longer afford to singlehandedly keep alonetone up, the popularity of the site and the sheer volume of 
    users needed to produce the cost would likely ensure that it would be kept afloat by other like-minded do good-ers.
    %br
    %br
    I have no current intention to pollute the site with advertising
    or treat the musicians on the site so poorly as to earn a living off of their music before they do. 
.faq    
  %h2.question
    How is the site built?
  %p.answer
    %br With love. 
    %br
    %br And Ruby. And rails. And the help of 1000s of Open Source programmers 
    %br who have made various pieces of this site without even knowing it themselves.

  %h2.question
    No, I mean I'm a programmer. Gimme the specs!
  %p.answer
    I've written about 1300 lines of ruby and about the same amount of javascript and css.
    %br We use 
    =link_to 'Attachment_fu', 'http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/attachment_fu/'
    =link_to 'Amazon S3 for mp3 hostng', 'http://aws.amazon.com'
    SASS, will_paginate, rspec,
    %br Sound is done with Sound Manager and unobtrusive javascript (Low Pro!)
.faq
  %h2.question
    Is the code open sourced?
  %p.answer
    Indeed. And I could use a hand if you are willing rails developer and/or designer. The rails code is available in the

    and you can
