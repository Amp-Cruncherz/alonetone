= The future is bright

The future of music distribution online, brought to you by Sudara

Amazing: We now live in a world where 1 person, in his spare time can provide limitless distribution for hundreds of artists, thousands of songs, millions of copies. Truly, we are at the beginning of a revolution in music making.

I invite you to join me in moving good music away from companies looking (still) to profit from musicians and help me to create the best damn online home for DIY / independent / online-savy musicians.

== Want to join forces?

First of all, talk to me. You can send me electronic mail. Sudara...at...nameofthisproject....com

The nameofthisproject and the production site is:

http://alonetone.com 

Here is the codebase, which is open source and open development.

== Set it up

You'll need to setup 5 config files for it to run flawlessly:

  database.yml
  amazon_s3.yml (you can always ignore this and set Asset and Pic to use the filesysem)
  basecamp.yml (for todo list, you don't need it unless you want pages/todo)
  defensio.yml (spam protection)
  facebooker.yml (for facebook app)

You'll need some gems, at least:
  rmagick
  haml
  facebooker
  ruby-mp3info
  mocha (for rspec)
  googlecharts
  aws-s3
  
If I were you, I would email me.
